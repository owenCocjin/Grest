## This is a redirect file
## It essentially just changes the names of actions, which can be helpful for things like obscuring action names
## Redirect files only apply to the directory they currently sit in
## Each redirect will be on it's own line
## The format for a redirect:
##   orig_action -> new_action
## The format for an alias:
##   orig_action + new_action
## To generate a random name:
## *     ; Random name
## *5    ; Random name, 5 chars
## *5-10 ; Random name, 5-10 chars
## To generate a random hex name:
## &     ; Random hex name
## &5    ; Random hex name, 5 chars
## &5-10 ; Random hex name, 5-10 chars



#Create 3 aliases pointing to "all"
all + example_1
all + example_2
all + example_3

#Create aliases to rename the original actions
all + everything
apps + rename_apps

#Rename "rename_apps" to a random string, 5 chars long
rename_apps -> *5

#Rename the "all" aliases to random hex strings of random lengths 5-10
example_1 -> &5-10
example_2 -> &5-10
example_3 -> &5-10
